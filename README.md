# Pandas-Challenge
The Heroes of Pymoli evaluates the csv file and builds several tables to get the meaningful insights from the data such as:
* Total purchases 
* Average purchase count
* Total revenue, etc

We also group the tables by certain values in order to understand:
* Number of players by gender
* Percentage of players by gender
* Purchasing values by gender

We create bins by age ranges to understand the percentage of players by age range and purchase values/average purchase price.

We groupby the data by top spenders in order to understand who spends most and the purchase values.

We finally group the data to understand which items generated the most purcahsing value.
